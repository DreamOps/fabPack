Packaging Utility for Salesforce Professionals
Fabrice Cathala - 14 May 2016

fabPack is a simple but efficient packaging utility that simplify moving meta-data packages in between Salesforce orgs.
Alternatively, fabPack is also ideal to build-up a features library.

fabPack is based on the Force.com Migration Toolkit hence relies on the latest JDK to be installed properly to be able to call ANT's jar.

fabPack saves time and reduces risk of manual mistakes.

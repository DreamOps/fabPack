Packaging Utility for Salesforce Professionals - Fabrice Cathala - 14 May 2016

**fabPack** is a simple but efficient packaging utility that simplify moving meta-data packages in between Salesforce orgs.
Alternatively, fabPack is also ideal to build-up a features library.

**fabPack** is based on the Force.com Migration Toolkit hence relies on the latest JDK to be installed properly to be able to call ANT's jar.

>**fabPack** saves time and reduces risk of manual mistakes. I can onnly recommend it to any Salesforce implementation teams dealing with lot of packaging work or willing to build a code library.
